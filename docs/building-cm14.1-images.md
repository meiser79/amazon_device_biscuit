# Building the CM14.1 Biscuit Images

> [!WARNING]
> **Amonet Biscuit v2.0.0 is required to install either generated OTA on a Biscuit.** The images target its TWRP 3.7.0_9-0 native A/B contract. v2 uses a Preloader exploit, removes GPT remapping and `lk-payload`, supports Fire OS 6 only, and intentionally removes stock non-hacked fastboot. Building does not require a connected device, but installation must not use stock recovery, stock fastboot, Amonet v1 instructions, or `boot_a_x` paths. Read the [upstream v2 announcement](https://xdaforums.com/t/unlock-root-twrp-unbrick-amazon-echo-dot-2nd-gen-2016-biscuit.4761416/page-12#post-90734139) and [Amonet 2 notes](amonet-biscuit-unlock.md) first.

This guide describes the two reproducible CM14.1 products in this repository:

| Product | Lunch target | Make target | What it is |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Full | `cm_biscuit-userdebug` | `make full` | Full Android/CM14.1 with the Android framework and Biscuit hardware integration. |
| Minimal | `biscuit_minimal-userdebug` | `make minimal` | Framework-free Android-shaped userspace for root ADB, Wi-Fi provisioning, DHCP/DNS, raw hardware access, and system add-ons. |

The minimal image intentionally contains no APKs and no `/system/framework` entries. It is not a reduced full Android image.

## Prerequisites

- A Linux host with Git, Docker, Python 3, `repo`, `curl`, `sha256sum`, and enough disk space for the CM14.1 checkout, downloads, outputs, and ccache.
- The repository checkout at its top level.
- Network access on the first sync/build so tracked scripts can obtain the pinned source archives and Fire OS inputs.
- For installation only: a Biscuit updated to **Amonet Biscuit v2.0.0** and booted into TWRP 3.7.0_9-0. Its own update changes early boot components, so follow the [upstream announcement](https://xdaforums.com/t/unlock-root-twrp-unbrick-amazon-echo-dot-2nd-gen-2016-biscuit.4761416/page-12#post-90734139) without interruption; see [Amonet 2 notes](amonet-biscuit-unlock.md).

The supported build images are created once when needed:

```sh
docker image inspect cm14.1-ubuntu20:latest >/dev/null 2>&1 || \
  docker build -t cm14.1-ubuntu20:latest \
    -f docker/cm14.1-ubuntu20.Dockerfile docker/

docker image inspect biscuit-kernel-builder:latest >/dev/null 2>&1 || \
  docker build -t biscuit-kernel-builder:latest \
    -f docker/biscuit-kernel-builder.Dockerfile docker/
```

## One-time source synchronization

```sh
scripts/sync.sh
```

This creates or updates the ignored `workspace/cm14.1` checkout using the tracked manifests. Do not make manual changes there: `scripts/stage-tree.sh` reconstructs the active overlay, proprietary closure, patch state, and Fire OS kernel source from tracked files.

## Build the full image

```sh
make full
docker logs -f cm14.1-biscuit-build
```

`make full` selects:

```txt
LUNCH_TARGET=cm_biscuit-userdebug
PATCH_PROFILE=full
```

The build script stages the flat Biscuit overlay, applies every patch in `patches/full/` in filename order, extracts the full verified Fire OS vendor closure, stages the Fire OS 6 Biscuit kernel, applies every patch in `patches/kernel/` in filename order, and starts the detached `cm14.1-biscuit-build` container.

The full product includes the Android framework, framework Wi-Fi/Bluetooth/audio paths, BiscuitService, the native LED daemon, headless-display compatibility, proprietary audio/radio/Bluetooth blobs, and the full patch profile. Use the [full-product smoke checklist](baseline-smoke-checks.md#full-product) after deployment.

## Build the framework-free minimal image

```sh
make minimal
docker logs -f cm14.1-biscuit-build
```

`make minimal` selects:

```txt
LUNCH_TARGET=biscuit_minimal-userdebug
PATCH_PROFILE=minimal
CLEAN_BISCUIT_OUT=1
```

The clean product-output step is deliberate: an incremental switch from the full product could otherwise leave full-framework files in the minimal system image. The build stages only the framework-free rootfs and the radio/Wi-Fi vendor closure, applies `patches/minimal/` in filename order plus the common kernel patches, and starts the same detached build container.

The minimal product supplies root USB/TCP ADB, `wpa_connect`, `wpa_passphrase`, `wpa_supplicant`, DHCP, `netd` DNS proxying, CA certificates, shell/network/debug tools, raw audio tools, and the replaceable `ledcontroller` service slot. It deliberately excludes the Android framework, APKs, Java BiscuitService, and Bluetooth framework/audio stack. Use the [framework-free minimal smoke checklist](baseline-smoke-checks.md#framework-free-minimal-product) after deployment.

## Switching products safely

Always use `make full` or `make minimal`; do not invoke a patch file manually. `scripts/stage-tree.sh` records the active profile and, when it changes, resets known generated upstream files, reverses the previous profile where necessary, and reapplies the selected profile fuzz-free.

Useful staging-only commands are:

```sh
make stage          # stage the full profile without building
make stage-minimal  # stage the minimal profile without building
make test           # static patch, product, kernel, Amonet 2, and OTA checks
```

## Artifacts and preflight

Both products write below:

```txt
workspace/cm14.1/out-docker/target/product/biscuit/
```

The full build normally produces a `cm_biscuit-ota-*.zip`; the minimal build normally produces a `biscuit_minimal-ota-*.zip`. Treat those names as build output, not a stable release API: inspect the directory after each successful build.

Before any installation, verify the generated updater. A safe Biscuit custom OTA:

- writes only `/dev/block/current-system` and `/dev/block/current-boot`;
- has no `dd`, manual BCB mutation, `boot_a_x`, or stale unsuffixed boot/system target;
- has no userdata/cache/recovery image or wipe command;
- uses the Amonet 2 current-slot assertion contract.

Use only confirmed Amonet 2 TWRP sideload for installation. The full A/B installation procedure belongs in [Amonet 2 notes](amonet-biscuit-unlock.md), not in a build script.

## Patch application model

Patch names are numbered because their order is part of the build contract. `scripts/apply-patches.sh` applies every `*.patch` in the selected directory lexically, fuzz-free, and idempotently. Shared patches are intentionally duplicated between `patches/full/` and `patches/minimal/` because the selected profile must be independently reproducible.

### Kernel patches applied to both products

| Patch | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `010-netfilter-xt-compat-percpu.patch` | Avoids zeroing per-CPU iptables entry pointers that the MTK 3.18 allocation path already initializes, preserving iptables/ip6tables table setup. |
| `020-force-ramdisk-root.patch` | Forces the known-good `root=/dev/ram rdinit=/init` kernel command line and ignores the unsafe Fire OS bootloader root/dm-verity command line that would otherwise panic before Android init. |
| `030-filter-bootloader-cmdline.patch` | Under forced root, copies only safe FDT boot arguments (`androidboot.serialno`, `androidboot.bootreason`, and `boot_reason`) so Android receives the real serial without reintroducing `root=`, `dm=`, or a stale slot suffix. |

### Full-product patches (`patches/full/`)

| Patch | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `001-amonet-fstab.patch` | Converts the MT8163 runtime fstab to the Amonet 2 bootdevice paths and `slotselect` contract for system and boot. |
| `002-amonet2-bcb-slotselect.patch` | Adds the Amonet 2 `/misc+0x360` BCB fallback to `fs_mgr` when `ro.boot.slot_suffix` is absent. |
| `003-skip-unused-ota-images.patch` | Lets the product skip cache and userdata image generation, reducing build work and unused OTA payload metadata. |
| `004-amazon-log-shim.patch` | Exports Amazon's `lab126_log_write` compatibility symbol from `liblog` for proprietary MT8163 display components. |
| `005-audio-legacy-symbols.patch` | Exports the remaining legacy logging/smart-pointer compatibility symbols required by the original Fire OS Amazon audio HAL closure. |
| `006-headless-system-props.patch` | Sets Biscuit headless properties and prevents selection of the unavailable Mali gralloc path. |
| `007-headless-no-gpu-property.patch` | Sets `ro.config.no_gpu=true` so framework and display patches take the headless path. |
| `008-mt8163-wifi-interface-property.patch` | Declares `wifi.interface=wlan0`, preventing the framework from cycling the working MTK Wi-Fi interface. |
| `009-bluetooth-board-cflags.patch` | Provides Biscuit-specific Bluedroid board CFLAGS, including the no-input pairing capability. |
| `010-biscuit-bluetooth-noinput-pairing.patch` | Disables the numeric-comparison callback path when Biscuit advertises no local input capability. |
| `011-biscuit-bluetooth-noinput-prototype.patch` | Guards the corresponding callback prototype and definition so the no-input Bluetooth build remains warning-clean. |
| `012-biscuit-bluetooth-headless-speaker.patch` | Enables A2DP Sink and AVRCP Controller behavior, automatic SSP confirmation/classic PIN handling, and sink connection priority for a headless speaker. |
| `013-biscuit-disable-pan-profile.patch` | Disables Bluetooth PAN/NAP, which is not part of the Biscuit speaker role. |
| `014-insecure-adb-default-props.patch` | Supports an explicitly requested root, unauthenticated ADB configuration for headless userdebug bring-up. |
| `015-biscuit-hostname-mdns.patch` | Derives a stable Biscuit hostname from model/serial data, passes it to `mdnssd`, and fixes the mDNS hostname length boundary. |
| `016-biscuit-flac-decoder.patch` | Adds and registers `OMX.google.flac.decoder`, its software FLAC library, and the required ACodec compatibility behavior. |
| `017-software-egl-fallback.patch` | Falls back to source-built software GLES when a proprietary EGL driver is unavailable. |
| `018-hwui-egl-config-fallback.patch` | Makes HWUI try a basic ES2/window EGL configuration before treating missing vendor configuration as fatal. |
| `019-headless-hwui-disable.patch` | Disables GPU/HWUI-dependent package and rendering behavior when `ro.config.no_gpu=true`. |
| `020-headless-hwc1-fake-display.patch` | Fallback for the stock API 1.0 HWC blob: with `ro.config.no_gpu=true` and no framebuffer device, SurfaceFlinger gets a fake 1x1 primary display instead of aborting. Not used while `hwcomposer.biscuit` (API 1.1) is selected. |
| `021-biscuit-radio-launchers.patch` | Starts the Fire OS 32-bit `wmt_loader` and `wmt_launcher`, applies MTK device-node permissions, and initializes the Biscuit radio stack. |
| `022-biscuit-sta-only-wifi.patch` | Removes unneeded AP, P2P, WPS, Wi-Fi Display, interworking, and related supplicant/framework paths for Biscuit STA operation. |
| `023-biscuit-mic-mute.patch` | Adds Biscuit microphone-mute key/service/broadcast handling so framework mute requests and the Biscuit control surface share state. |
| `024-biscuit-disable-framework-p2p.patch` | Explicitly reports Wi-Fi Direct/P2P as unsupported on Biscuit even when generic framework feature discovery would enable it. |
| `025-amazon-audio-wrapper.patch` | Builds the MT8163 primary-audio wrapper and compatibility shims around the original Fire OS Amazon audio HAL. |
| `026-biscuit-audio-route-wrapper.patch` | Adds the proven TLV320 baseline speaker route and controls the external amplifier around output activity. |
| `027-biscuit-audio-route-forwarding.patch` | Correctly forwards full audio HAL/device/stream ABI calls to the real Fire OS objects while retaining only the route/amplifier interception. |
| `028-biscuit-audio-gpio-mic-mute.patch` | Lets audioserver access the Amazon GPIO87 mute path and preserves/report the real hardware microphone-mute state. |

### Minimal-product patches (`patches/minimal/`)

| Patch | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `001-amonet2-bcb-slotselect.patch` | Adds the same Amonet 2 BCB slot fallback needed by the framework-free init/fstab path. |
| `002-skip-unused-ota-images.patch` | Avoids cache/userdata image generation for the minimal product. |
| `003-insecure-adb-default-props.patch` | Provides the explicit root, unauthenticated ADB properties used by the minimal headless system. |
| `004-sta-only-wpa-supplicant.patch` | Builds a small STA-only supplicant by disabling WPS, AP, P2P, Wi-Fi Display, HS20, interworking, and their unsupported control paths. |
| `005-wpa-passphrase.patch` | Exposes CM14's existing `wpa_passphrase.c` as the reproducibly built `/system/bin/wpa_passphrase` utility. |
| `006-sepolicy-exfat-ntfs-types.patch` | Defines the exFAT and NTFS file types otherwise supplied by CM common sepolicy, which minimal deliberately does not inherit. |
| `007-framework-free-systemimage-trim.patch` | Filters framework/default/debug/recovery leftovers from the minimal system image while retaining its explicit runtime manifest. |

## Headless display

Biscuit has no panel and its kernel has no framebuffer driver (`CONFIG_MTK_FB` is off and the MediaTek display sources are not part of the Fire OS drop). SurfaceFlinger still needs a primary display, a vsync source and a place to post frames.

- `device/amazon/biscuit/hwcomposer/` builds `hwcomposer.biscuit`, a headless HWC with API 1.1. SurfaceFlinger reads the display from it, so no framebuffer device is needed. It reports one primary display (default 320x320, 60 Hz, 213 dpi), no external display, marks every layer `HWC_FRAMEBUFFER` (composition stays in SurfaceFlinger's GLES, software GL is fine), discards the finished frame and generates vsync in software.
- `device.mk` selects it with `ro.hardware.hwcomposer=biscuit`. Remove that property to fall back to the stock `hwcomposer.mt8163.so` (API 1.0) together with patch `020`.
- The display size can be changed without a rebuild: `setprop debug.biscuit.hwc.size 240x320; stop; start` (`WxH`, 1..4096, invalid values fall back to 320x320). It is read when SurfaceFlinger opens the HWC.
- Check on the device: `dumpsys SurfaceFlinger | grep -A3 "Hardware Composer state"` must show version `01010001` and the line `Biscuit headless HWC 1.1`.
- Host test (plain, ASan/UBSan and TSan builds): `bash tests/test-hwc-host.sh`. It needs the headers from a synced CM14.1 tree, or `HWC_HEADERS` and `SYSCORE_HEADERS`.

## Static validation

Run before treating a build as ready for preflight:

```sh
make test
git diff --check
```

The test suite checks ordered, fuzz-free patch application; both product contracts; minimal-product exclusions; Amonet 2 slot handling; OTA paths; kernel command-line handling; and LED behavior. It does not replace inspecting the actual generated OTA before a device installation.
